            I chose to create my Christmas Lists on GitHub, hosted through HashBase.IO,
            because HashBase provides an easy way to host HTML with a link for anyone to
            view. I needed HTML because, nerd that I am, my Christmas lists have become too
            complex for any other format.

            "So why HTML?" you ask. Well, as stated above, nerds like me often refuse to do
            things the easy way. As I've become more of a nerd, I've found myself more and
            more interested in complex structures&mdash;for better or for worse&mdash;and
            Christmas has not escaped my wrath. I&rsquo;ve recently begun to envision "gift
            packages" of more than one gift, and to easily distribute these ideas to my
            relatives, I need HTML to group the necessary links together. Also, to a nerd,
            this way is just more <i>fun</i>.
